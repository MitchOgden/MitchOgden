## My Name is Mitchell Ogden

I am a dabbler of many things; 3D printing, biking, coding, gaming, geocaching, golfing horribly, guitar playing, hacking, hiking.... many things. I am addicted to having too many projects going at a time. Thrive under self-imposed pressure and unrealistic deadlines. 

### Markdown

Currently I am enjoying a dive into penetration testing using Arduino Boards, Raspberry Pi, and Onion Omega2.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MitchOgden/MitchOgden/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
