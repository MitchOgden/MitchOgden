## My Name is Mitchell Ogden

I am a dabbler of many things; 3D printing, biking, coding, gaming, geocaching(newly), golfing horribly, guitar playing, hacking, hiking.... many things. I am addicted to having too many projects going at a time. Thrive under self-imposed pressure and unrealistic deadlines. 

### Current Dive

Currently I am enjoying a dive into penetration testing using Arduino Boards, Raspberry Pi, and Onion Omega2.
